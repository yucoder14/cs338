Refined Project Proposal

Partners: Changwoo, Mauricio

We plan to explore digital steganography. Steganography is the practice of hiding data within some data, such as images, to avoid detection.
Proposal: Most likely, we will prepare github repository, containing brief history of steganography, instructions and the code to perform steganography, allowing interest parties to toy with our code and learn about steganography. We will be using python to write our code, for it has a robust image processing library (Pillow).
Goal: to successfully hide a text message inside a chosen image and extract the message from a altered image. If we have time, we will also attempt to hide and extract audio files, and images (watermark) inside images.
